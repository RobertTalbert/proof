# Guided Practice for Section 7.2: Equivalence Relations

## Overview 
Now that we’ve learned about relations in general, we’re going to narrow our focus to relations that satisfy three important properties: **reflexivity** (every element of the base set is related to itself), **symmetry** (if a is related to b then b is related to a for all a,b in the base set) and **transitivity** (if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c for all a,b,c in the base set). Many of the most important mathematical relations satisfy all three of these properties. Such relations are called **equivalence relations** and, equivalence relations are a powerful tool for expressing similarity among objects that appear dissimilar. 

## Learning objectives
* Determine whether a relation is symmetric, reflexive, and/or transitive. Give examples of relations which have exactly zero, one, two, or three of these three properties.
* State and instantiate the definition of "equivalence relation" on a set, and use correct mathematical notation when working with equivalence relations.
* Give examples of standard mathematical equivalence relations, including equality, congruence modulo n, and equivalence of rational numbers. 


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 375-382** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 18 minutes, 33 seconds:
