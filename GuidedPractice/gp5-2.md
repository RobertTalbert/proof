# Guided Practice for Section 5.3: Properties of Set Operations

## Overview 
In this section we look at three basic strategies for proving statements that involve sets: How to prove one set is a subset of another set, how to prove two sets are equal, and how to prove two sets are disjoint. The first two revolve around the “choose an element” approach which uses the fact that a statement about subset inclusion is a conditional statement. 

## Learning objectives
Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 5.18 (Algebra of
      Set Operations).
Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 5.20.
Prove that three or more statements are equivalent. 



## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 230–238** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 27 minutes, 44 seconds:
