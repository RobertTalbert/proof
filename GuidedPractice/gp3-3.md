# Guided Practice for Section 3.3: Proof by Contradiction

## Overview 
This section introduces a centrally important logical tool for communicating in mathematics: The concept of **proof by contradiction**. We will come to grips with this technique and apply it to a number of propositions previously inaccessible to us, especially proofs of propositions given “in the negative”. 

## Learning objectives
* Explain the basic strategy behind a proof by contradiction and why such a proof should be convincing.
* Correctly formulate all the assumptions made at the beginning of a proof by contradiction, and then correctly state what you want to show having made those assumptions.
* Explain some situations in which a proof by contradiction might be an appropriate strategy for proof. 
* Construct a correct proof by contradiction for a proposition when it makes sense to do so, including: proofs of the nonexistence of an object, proofs involving rational and irrational numbers, and so on.
* Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational. 


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 116–125 in the textbook**. Remember that “reading” means not only attending to the words on the page but also interacting with the worked-out examples and trying the progress checks. You can try some exercises too if you’re up for it. 

*Viewing:* Watch the following screencasts, which run a total of 20 minutes, 45 seconds:

## Specifications

* Please **write up your responses to Practice exercises 1–2**. Please use software to type up your responses this time; no handwritten work will be accepted. If you want to use LaTeX, see the Piazza thread on “Learning “LaTeX” about using LaTeX. There is a LaTeX template on Blackboard near this Guided Practice assignment that has a sample truth table you can modify. **Hand this paper in at the beginning of class on September 21**. 
* For Practice exercise 4 (your questions or comments), there is a discussion thread set up on Piazza for this item. **Go to Piazza, find the thread, and leave your question or comment no later than 8:00am on September 21**.
