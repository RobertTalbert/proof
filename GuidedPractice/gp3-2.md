# Guided Practice for Section 3.2: More methods of proof

## Overview 
This section extends our toolbox for working with proofs by introducing three new kinds of proof: **proof by contraposition** (where we prove the contrapositive of a statement instead of the statement), **proofs of biconditional statements**, and **constructive proofs**. 

## Learning objectives
* (*Review*) Write the contrapositive of a conditional statement. 
* Construct a proof for a conditional statement by proving its contrapositive. 
* Construct a proof for a biconditional statement by proving two conditional statements. 
* Explain the concept of a "constructive proof" and write a correct constructive proof for a proposition when it makes sense to do so. 
* Explain the difference between a constructive and non-constructive proof.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 102–111 in the textbook**. Remember that “reading” means not only attending to the words on the page but also interacting with the worked-out examples and trying the progress checks. You can try some exercises too if you’re up for it. 

*Viewing:* Watch the following screencasts, which run a total of 35 minutes, 38 seconds:

## Practice 

1. Consider the statement given in Exercise 3 of this section. (I’d reprint it here except there’s mathematical notation.) What does its contrapositive say? And if you were going to prove this statement, why might it be preferable in this case to prove the contrapositive instead? 
2. Why is it that we can prove “existence theorems” (as described on page 110 and in the fifth screencast) by constructing something specific? How is this method of proof different than trying to prove a theorem by giving examples? 
3. What questions or comments do you have about the content in Section 3.2? 

 
## Specifications

* Please **write up your responses to Practice exercises 1–2**. Please use software to type up your responses this time; no handwritten work will be accepted. If you want to use LaTeX, see the Piazza thread on “Learning “LaTeX” about using LaTeX. There is a LaTeX template on Blackboard near this Guided Practice assignment that has a sample truth table you can modify. **Hand this paper in at the beginning of class on September 19**. 
* For Practice exercise 4 (your questions or comments), there is a discussion thread set up on Piazza for this item. **Go to Piazza, find the thread, and leave your question or comment no later than 8:00am on September 19**.
