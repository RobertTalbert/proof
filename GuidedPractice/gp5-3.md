# Guided Practice for Section 5.4: Cartesian Products

## Overview 
This section establishes a number of basic set identities that we can use to prove other set identities. In particular we introduce an “algebra of sets” method for proving results about sets that complements the “choose-an-element” method learned in earlier sections. We also learn what it means to prove a result of the form “the following are equivalent”. 

## Learning objectives
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 5.18 (Algebra of Set Operations).
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 5.20.
* Prove results about sets using an “algebra of sets” approach. 
* Prove that three or more statements are equivalent. 

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 244–251** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 35 minutes, 47 seconds:
