# Guided Practice for Section 7.1: Relations

## Overview 
Our final chapter (!) in MTH 210 focuses on the concept of a *relation*. A relation is a very simple mathematical construction that is like a function without the usual restrictions on input-splitting and using up the whole domain. Relations model a number of mathematical relationships and can be thought of in two representations — as *ordered pairs*, and as a *directed graph*. 

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definition of a "relation" from one set to another (or on a set by itself).
* Find the domain and the range of a relation. 
* Work with standard mathematical relations given in Table 7.1.
* Draw the directed graph for a relation.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 362-370** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 12 minutes, 16 seconds:

* [Directed graphs for relations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD4wwbPICUU) (5:23)
