# Guided Practice for Section 7.3: Equivalence Classes

## Overview 
Equivalence relations provide us with a way of grouping together elements of a set in an organized and structured way using the concept of **equivalence classes**. Generally speaking, if ~ is an equivalence relation on a set A and x is an element of A, the equivalence class of x is the set of all elements of A that are equivalent to x under ~ . You’ve encountered this sort of set already a few times, for example in the class work from Wednesday. In this section, we define and instantiate this concept, prove three important properties about equivalence classes (they are never empty; two classes are equal if and only if their representatives are equivalent; and classes are always either equal or disjoint) and look at the concept of a **partition** of a set. 

## Learning objectives
* Determine the equivalence class of a point under a given equivalence relation.
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 7.14 (properties of equivalence classes).
* State and instantiate the definition of a "partition" of a set.
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 7.18 (equivalence classes yield partitions) .
