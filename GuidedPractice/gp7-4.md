# Guided Practice for Section 7.4: Modular Arithmetic

## Overview 
We finish up this section and the course with a look at an application of equivalence relations and classes in the form of modular arithmetic. This is a new arithmetic system we invent on the set of equivalence classes related to integer congruence mod n. We first define the set of integers mod n using this relation, then define and describe the operations of addition and multiplication on equivalence classes. The third and fourth videos round out the subject with two applications, one in proving a familiar test for divisibility and another showing how modular arithmetic can be used in cryptology. 

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definition of the "set of integers modulo n" (Z_n).
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorems 3.28 and Corollary 7.19 (properties of modular arithmetic).
* Carry out addition and multiplication modulo n.
* Prove the validity of divisibility tests for 3 and 9.


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 400-407** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 46 minutes, 40 seconds:

* [The integers modulo n](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9Xxdoeg7I) (6:40)
* [Modular arithmetic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liNgbAG3CXM) (11:07)
* [Divisibility by 3 test](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnAiGao3ZR8) (13:09)
* [Affine ciphers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7KL5u56upw) (15:44)

The last video is considered optional with respect to the learning objectives, but you might find it interesting, and it should give you a deeper understanding of how modular arithmetic works. 

## Practice exercises

This Guided Practice does not have a web form because you’ll need to do some calculating that doesn’t translate well into plain text. So just write these up (LaTeX not necessary) and hand them in at class time on Monday, December 3. 

1. List all the elements of Z_{26}, the integers modulo 26. The notation must be correct here. 
2. Below are several equivalence classes in sets of integers mod n. State the equivalence class to which each one is equal, that belongs to Z_n. For example, [25] in Z_{10} is the same class as [5]. 
	* [44] in the integers modulo 7
	* [9999] in the integers modulo 3
	* [-12] in the integers modulo 5
	* [1492] in the integers modulo 29
3. Make complete addition and multiplication tables for Z_6, the integers modulo 6. 

There is also a Piazza thread, as usual, for you to submit your questions and comments on this section.
