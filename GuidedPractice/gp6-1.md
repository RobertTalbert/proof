# Guided Practice for Section 6.1: Introduction to Functions

## Overview 
This section introduces — though not for the first time — the concept of the function. Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, and our goal in this chapter is to arrive at a deep and rigorous understanding of functions and how they work. This first section introduces important terminology through the definition of *function*, *domain*, *codomain*, *image*, *preimage*, and *range*. We do a lot of instantiation of these terms through familiar and more exotic examples.  

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definitions of "function", "domain", "codomain", "range", "image" (of a point and of a function), and "preimage" (of a point), and use correct mathematical notation when working with functions. 
* Exhibit fluency with working with functions whose domains or codomains are not sets of real numbers and which are not given by closed-form formulas (e.g. the birthday function, the sum of divisors function).
* Represent a function between finite sets using an arrow diagram.


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 281-290** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 64 minutes, 4 seconds. Note: The “Function Example” videos do not need to be viewed in order.
