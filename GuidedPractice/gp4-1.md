# Guided Practice for Section 4.1: The Principle of Mathematical Induction

## Overview 
In this chapter we begin a look at one of the most important concepts in mathematics: The idea of mathematical induction. This is a method of looking at and solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into a smaller, simpler version of itself and using this similarity to solve the main problem. It’s a powerful and widely-used way of thinking in mathematics. We are spending two classes on this section. 

## Learning objectives
* State the Principle of Mathematical Induction and explain why it is true.
* Explain the basic strategy behind a proof by induction and why such a proof should be convincing.
* State the basis step in a proof by induction.
* State the inductive step and the inductive hypothesis in a proof by induction.
* Construct a complete and correct proof using mathematical induction.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* This time your reading is going to be broken up a little, and not all of the section will be assigned. So for Friday, read: 

* Preview Activity 1. 
* Pages 172–180, starting with the subsection titled “The Principle of Mathematical Induction” which is at the bottom of page 172. Also, the section on summation notation should be read, but if you have trouble understanding this, it is not essential for understanding the section. 

*Viewing:* There are a lot of screencasts for this section because more examples will help you acquire the ideas better. Here is the complete list: 

* [The Traveler and the Strange Staircase](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LwAtbXSB3A) (3:19)
* [Mathematical Induction, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTj6ID4-084) (5:23)
* [Mathematical Induction, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H0gg3fMYVA) (6:16)
* [Mathematical induction: Example with integer division](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayX6PxB3z40) (7:05)
* [Mathematical induction: Example with inequality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upzROTcbAnk) (4:45)
* [Mathematical induction: Example with calculus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ9fUZxmN8I) (8:27)
* Mathematical induction: Example with graph theory 

For Friday’s class, watch at least the first five videos (total running time: 26 minutes, 48 seconds). By Monday, watch all the rest. 


## Practice exercises
1. Work all the parts of Preview Activity 1. 
2. Look at the statement in exercise 8(a) on page 181. Let’s suppose we were going to prove this by mathematical induction. What would you need to do in the base case? What would be the inductive hypothesis? And what would you need to prove once you’ve assumed the inductive hypothesis? 
3. What questions or comments do you have about the content in Section 4.1? 

 
## Specifications

* Please **write up your responses to Practice exercises 1–2**. Please use software to type up your responses this time; no handwritten work will be accepted. If you want to use LaTeX, see the Piazza thread on “Learning “LaTeX” about using LaTeX. There is a LaTeX template on Blackboard near this Guided Practice assignment that has a sample truth table you can modify. **Hand this paper in at the beginning of class on October 5**. 
* For Practice exercise 4 (your questions or comments), there is a discussion thread set up on Piazza for this item. **Go to Piazza, find the thread, and leave your question or comment no later than 8:00am on October 5**.
