# Guided Practice for Section 1.2: Constructing Direct Proofs

## Overview 
Having learned about statements, how conditional statements work, and the process of exploration and conjecture-making, we move on to the all-important concept of **writing mathematical proofs**. In this section we learn what a proof is, and a framework for constructing a *direct proof* for a conditional statement. Constructing a proof is a complicated, high-level process but we can always get started and know where we are headed. 

## Learning objectives
*  Construct examples and non-examples of a definition. (We call this “instantiating” a definition.)
*  Construct a "know-show" table for a direct proof by use of both
      forward questions and backward questions.
*  Convert a know-show table into a verbal proof (using the
      standards for writing outlined in the syllabus).
*  Explain what a mathematical proof is, in general.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* Read pages 15–26 in the textbook. Remember that “reading” means not only attending to the words on the page but also interacting with the worked-out examples and trying the progress checks. 

*Viewing:* Watch the following screencasts, which run a total of 35 minutes, 38 seconds (44:20 if you do the optional second video): 

* [Working with definitions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoqoSxUoK-A&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=6&feature=plpp_video) (9:26)
* *OPTIONAL*: [Working with definitions, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-itAHieTfI&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=7&feature=plpp_video) (8:42)
* [Direct proofs of conditional statements using know-show tables, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8LLINU6ebY&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=8&feature=plpp_video) (8:24)
* [Direct proofs of conditional statements using know-show tables, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tCOucLfdh0&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=9&feature=plpp_video) (8:32)
* [Writing up a proof outline into a paragraph](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55p4Ehdl7AY&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=10&feature=plpp_video) (9:16)

I recommend you do the reading first, before trying out the videos this time. 

## Practice 

1. An integer, *a*, is said to be a **type 0 integer** if there exists another integer *n* such that *a* = *3n*. Give at least four different integers that are type 0 integers and explain. Then give four examples of different integers that are *not* type 0 integers, and explain. 
2. Answer all five questions of Preview Activity 2. 
3. What questions or comments do you have about the content of Section 1.2? 
 
## Specifications

* Please **write up your responses to Practice 1–2**. Please use software to type up your responses this time; no handwritten work will be accepted. See the Piazza thread on “Learning “LaTeX” about . **Hand this paper in at the beginning of class on August 31**. 
* For Practice 3 (your questions or comments), there is a discussion thread set up on Piazza for this item. **Go to Piazza, find the thread, and leave your question or comment no later than 8:00am on August 31**. Please leave *something* and don’t say “I have no questions”. The question/comment you leave needs to be about the section, not about the class.
