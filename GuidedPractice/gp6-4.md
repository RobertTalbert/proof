# Guided Practice for Section 6.4: Composition of Functions

## Overview 
This section focuses on function composition, which is the process of taking two or more functions that are “compatible” (in a way made rigorous in your reading) and connecting them together to make one large function.

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definition of the "composition" of two functions.
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 6.20.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 323-330** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 16 minutes, 36 seconds:

* [Compositions of functions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_t1I3WgXbM) (8:42)
* [Proving results involving composition of functions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRabzSd_o4w) (7:54)
