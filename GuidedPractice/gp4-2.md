# Guided Practice for Section 4.2: Other Forms of Mathematical Induction

## Overview 
This section introduces two variations on the theme of mathematical induction: The Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction (for situations where a predicate may not be true for n = 1 but looks true for all integers past a threshhold) and the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction (for situations where knowledge of P(k) may not be helpful in establishing P(k+1)). This allows us to apply inductive thinking to a larger variety of problems. 

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definitions of n! (n factorial), "prime number", and "composite number".
* State the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction; explain how it is different from the Principle of Mathematical Induction and why we might want to use it.
* Construct a complete and correct proof using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction.
* State the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction; explain how it is different from the Principle of Mathematical Induction and why we might want to use it.
* Construct a complete and correct proof using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction.
