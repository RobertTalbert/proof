# Guided Practice for Section 5.1: Sets and Set Operations

## Overview 
Chapter 5 is an in-depth look at sets — fundamental structures that underlie all of mathematics — and how to prove things about them. In this section we remind ourselves what a set is, and then we introduce four operations on sets: intersection, union, difference, and complement. We also touch on the notions of the power set of a set and then have a brief discussion of cardinality, which has to do with the “size” of a set (although this is a tricky concept for infinite sets). 

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definitions of "intersection", "union", "set difference", "complement", "proper subset"
* Illustrate the concepts of intersection, union, difference, and complement using a Venn diagram.
* Phrase a statement about proper subsets into a quantified statement and vice-versa.
* State and use the result of Theorem 5.2 (test for set equality).
* Construct the power set of a finite set.
* State and instantiate the definition of "cardinality" of a finite set.

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 215–238** in the Sundstrom textbook. That’s longer than usual, but there are also a lot of pictures. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 35 minutes, 29 seconds:
