# Guided Practice for Section 6.3: Injections, Surjections, and Bijections (part 2)

## Overview 
The second part of our coverage of this section focuses on surjections (functions whose range and codomain are equal) and bijections (functions that are both injections and surjections). 

## Learning objectives
For Friday’s class, focus only on surjections and bijections. 
* State and instantiate the definitions of "injection", "surjection", and "bijection".
* Determine whether a given function is an injection, surjection, or bijection. 
* Give examples of functions that are injections but not surjections; surjections but not injections; neither injections nor surjections; or bijections. 

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 311–317** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 24 minutes, 53 seconds:

* [Surjective functions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVniPMIexQE) (9:03)
* [How to prove a function is an surjection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQBXnx1Tbg) (15:50)
