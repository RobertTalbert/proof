# Guided Practice for Section 5.4: Cartesian Products

## Overview 
In this section we introduce a set operation that may be new to you — the Cartesian product. Actually it’s not new. The Cartesian product is a way of taking two sets and making a new set out of it that consists of ordered pairs of elements from the first two sets. We define the Cartesian product and prove some of its basic properties. 

## Learning objectives
* State and instantiate the definitions of "ordered pair", "coordinates", and the "Cartesian product" of two sets.
* Visualize Cartesian products of sets of real numbers in the plane.
* Derive, state, and use the results of Theorem 5.25. 


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 255–262** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks. 

*Viewing:* View the following screencasts, which run for a total of 19 minutes, 44 seconds:
