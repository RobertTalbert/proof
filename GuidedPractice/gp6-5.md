# Guided Practice for Section 6.4: Inverse Functions

## Overview 
This section introduces a new way to represent a function: As a set of ordered pairs. This will allow us to work with functions using set theory operations we learned earlier. And with that representation, we introduce the concept of the inverse of a function by reversing the order of the ordered pairs in a function. 

## Learning objectives
* Represent a function as a set of ordered pairs.
* Determine if a set of ordered pairs from A x B defines a function from A to B. 
* Given a function represented a as set of ordered pairs from A x B, tell whether the function is injective and/or surjective. 
* State and instantiate the definition of the "inverse" of a function.
* Derive, state, and use the result of Theorem 6.25 (conditions under which f^{-1} is a function).
* Explain the notation for inverse functions and use this notation correctly.
* Derive, state, and use the result of Corollary 6.28 (compositions of inverse functions). 

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 334-344** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks.
