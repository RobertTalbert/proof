# Guided Practice for Section 2.1: Statements and Logical Operators

## Overview 
We return back to the concept of a statement by examining statements that are made up of smaller statements joined together by logical operators. These are called **compound statements**, and the operators we’ll examine are the words **and**, **or**, **not**, and **if-then**. (We learned about if-then statements in Section 1.1.) We’ll also learn about the biconditional statement or “if and only if” statement. Just as with conditional statements in Section 1.1, we will explore the conditions under which compound statements are true or false and learn how to construct **truth tables** to make this determination easy. 

## Learning objectives
* Identify the conjunction, disjunction, negation, and implication operators and use their notation correctly.
* Phrase the negation of a statement in a way that does not use the word "not".
* Construct truth tables for conjunctions, disjunctions, negations, and implications.
* Phrase a conditional statement in several different English formats.
* Construct truth tables for compound statements involving three or more variables.
* Identify a biconditional statement; construct a truth table and phrase it in several different English formats.
* Define the terms "tautology" and "contradiction" and use truth tables to determine if a statement is a tautology or a contradiction.


## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* Read pages 33–40 in the textbook. Remember that “reading” means not only attending to the words on the page but also interacting with the worked-out examples and trying the progress checks. 

*Viewing:* Watch the following screencasts, which run a total of 43 minutes, 19 seconds: 

* [Negations of simple statements](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG6zHqt9PsI) (3:34)
* [Truth tables, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2yksDk4h6s) (6:07)
* [Truth tables, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRryCRG4Tk)  (5:50)
* [Truth tables, part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j0DsAWbP7E) (6:17)
* [Truth tables, part 4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GD25pbPTFs) (7:04)
* [Truth tables, part 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJzDrQGQEpM) (3:25)
* [Tautologies and contradictions, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6_Yldevy5s) (6:44)
* [Tautologies and contradictions, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nB1e64CzJM) (4:18)

NOTE: This is probably the longest set of videos you’ll get all semester, but the five Truth Table videos are just worked-out examples. If you feel like you are understanding the construction of truth tables just by reading the book and working through the Progress Checks and don’t need additional examples, you don’t have to watch all of these videos. I do recommend you watch “Part 3” at least, since this is an example using three variables — a topic that gives some students trouble. 

On the flip side — if you need *more* examples, please let me know and I can make more videos. 

## Practice 

1. Work Progress Check 2.1 parts 1, 3, and 4. 
2. In your own words, how do you keep straight the difference between “is necessary for” and “is sufficient for”? 
3. Go to Exercise 6 in Section 2.1 and construct one of the four truth tables it asks for.
4. What questions or comments do you have about the content in Section 2.1? 
 
## Specifications

* Please **write up your responses to Practice 1–3**. Please use software to type up your responses this time; no handwritten work will be accepted. See the Piazza thread on “Learning “LaTeX” about using LaTeX; there is a LaTeX template on Blackboard near this Guided Practice assignment that has a sample truth table you can modify. **Hand this paper in at the beginning of class on August 31**. 
* For Practice 4 (your questions or comments), there is a discussion thread set up on Piazza for this item. **Go to Piazza, find the thread, and leave your question or comment no later than 8:00am on September 5**. Please leave *something* and don’t say “I have no questions”. The question/comment you leave needs to be about the section, not about the class.
