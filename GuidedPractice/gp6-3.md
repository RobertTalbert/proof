## Learning objectives
For Wednesday’s class, focus only on injections. Friday’s class will focus on surjections and bijections. 

* State and instantiate the definitions of "injection", "surjection", and "bijection".
* Determine whether a given function is an injection, surjection, or bijection. 
* Give examples of functions that are injections but not surjections; surjections but not injections; neither injections nor surjections; or bijections. 

## Resources for reading and viewing
*Reading:* **Read pages 294-302** in the Sundstrom textbook. Remember to read the proofs carefully — these are additional examples for your benefit — and try the Progress Checks.
