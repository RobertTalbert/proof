# Guided Practice for Section 4.3: Induction and Recursion

## Overview 
Our final section in the chapter on mathematical induction introduces the idea of **recursion**, which is the computational counterpart to induction. Recursion is to calculations what induction is to proofs. In particular we introduce the notion of the **recursively defined sequence** and the special **Fibonacci sequence**, and we begin to explore some properties of the Fibonacci sequence that can be proven using induction.  

## Learning objectives
* List elements of a sequence whose terms are defined recursively (including the integers in the Fibonacci sequence). 
* Construct proofs using mathematical induction for propositions involving recursively-defined sequences.
