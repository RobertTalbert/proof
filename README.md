Greetings. This repository contains materials for **MTH 210, Communicating in Mathematics**. This is a transition-to-proof course taught at [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu). The materials here are from the Fall 2012 offering of the course taught by me ([Robert Talbert](http://faculty.gvsu.edu)) using the inverted or "flipped" class design. 

Here's what's in this repository: 

+ **Activities** contains in-class activities and entrance quizzes students worked on during class. 
+ **CourseDocs** contains syllabi and other "housekeeping" documentation. 
+ **Exams** contains tests, final exams, and clicker questions used for exam review. 
+ **GuidedPractice** contains the Guided Practice assignments students did prior to class, to learn new material on their own and prepare for more advanced work in class. 
+ **Portfolio** contains problems and informational documents about the Proof Portfolio, a major writing assignment worth 30% of students' grades. 

The video content for this course consists of 107 videos, over 14 hours of content, [housed at this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2419488168AE7001) on the GVSU Math Department YouTube channel.
